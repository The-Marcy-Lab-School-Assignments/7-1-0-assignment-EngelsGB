# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InstagramContext from "./InstagramContext";

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
  const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

  const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

  return (
    <InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </InstagramContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```

# Answer

The `children` prop will be all the components or elements in between the the `InstagramContext.Provider` component tags, meaning that it will wrap all components in between its opening and closing tags.

Your answer correctly explains what the children prop is and how it works within the InstagramContextProvider. However, it would be more accurate to mention that in the "Global Context Provider" pattern, the provider typically wraps the root component, like <App />, in the main entry file.
